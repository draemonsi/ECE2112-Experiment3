**PROBLEM 2:** Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py<br/>
Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and
indexing operations.<br/>
a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7...) of cars.<br/>
b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.<br/>
c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?<br/>
